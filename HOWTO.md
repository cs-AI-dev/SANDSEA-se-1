# How to Use the Sandsea Simulation Engine  
This is a step-by-step instructional guide to creating your own simulation and using the engine.
### Regarding updates  
Keep in mind that this document might update at a slightly different rate/time than the engine, but the team will keep this as relevant as possible! Don't
expect any of the core features to change, but when they do, check the `UPDATES` folder and look at the most recent update to check if any semantics or nitty-gritty bits
have changed, or maybe if a feature was added/tweaked.
### Regarding .SSD (*S*and*S*ea*D*ata) files  
Edit the code all you want; worst-case-scenario you can redownload the engine and reload your auto-backups. .SSD files are encrypted pieces of data that allow Sandsea to
run properly. The version number, backup location, and similar data are all stored under .SSDs. While I think it's ok for you to edit other files for compatibility on your
device, it's not recommended that you edit these files because it might break the engine. (quite possibly the backups too - say goodbye to your simulations.)
### Sandsong Syntax  
- `$ new object`
  - `$ new object cuboid <start coordinates> <end coordinates> <material, default simulo> <connect, default true>` - Creates a new cuboid object in the simulation of the specified material (under the `material` parameter). The cuboid is rendered as the start and end coordinates being coordinates opposite each other on the cuboid, the start coordinate being closest to (0,0,0) and the end coordinate being the farthest, and as a function that collides with an object if any part of the object is within the range of each coordinate of the vertices. The `connect` parameter defines if the cuboid automatically merges with other objects that would be touching or inside of it during its generation, and is defaulted to `true`.
  - `$ new object sphere <center> <radius, default 0> <material, default simulo> <connect, default true>` - Creates a new sphere object in the simulation of the specified material (under the `material` parameter). The sphere is rendered as the radius extending from the center coordinates, as one would expect, and as a function that collides with an object if any part of the object is equal to or less than a number of units equal to the radius away from the center of the sphere. The `connect` parameter defines if the cuboid automatically merges with other objects that would be touching or inside of it during its generation, and is defaulted to `true`.
  - `$ new object ellipsoid <X-radius, default 0> <Y-radius, default 0> <Z-radius, default 0> <material, default simulo> <connect, default true>` - Creates a new ellipsoid object in the simulation of the specified material (under the `material`). The ellipsoid is rendered as a spheroid, being extended in a direction based on which axis the coordinate is for - the X-axis is extended by the X-radius, the Y by the Y, etc., and as a function that collides with an object if any part of the object is inside the Z-coord-modified elliptical function. The `connect` parameter defines if the cuboid automatically merges with other objects that would be touching or inside of it during its generation, and is defaulted to `true`.
  - `$ new object cylinder <base coordinates> <radius, default 0> <height, default 0> <axis, default z> <material, default simulo> <connect, default true>` - Creates a new cylinder object in the simulation of the specified material (under the `material` parameter). The cylinder is rendered as the base extended by the radius and height (which MUST BE POSITIVE) and which collides with an object if the object is within a circular function and within a range along the selected axis under `axis` parameter. The `connect` parameter defines if the cuboid automatically merges with other objects that would be touching or inside of it during its generation, and is defaulted to `true`.
