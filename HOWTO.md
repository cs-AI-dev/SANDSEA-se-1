# How to Use the Sandsea Simulation Engine  
This is a step-by-step instructional guide to creating your own simulation and using the engine.
### Regarding updates  
Keep in mind that this document might update at a slightly different rate/time than the engine, but the team will keep this as relevant as possible! Don't
expect any of the core features to change, but when they do, check the `UPDATES` folder and look at the most recent update to check if any semantics or nitty-gritty bits
have changed, or maybe if a feature was added/tweaked.
### Regarding .SSD (*S*and*S*ea*D*ata) files  
Edit the code all you want; worst-case-scenario you can redownload the engine and reload your auto-backups. .SSD files are encrypted pieces of data that allow Sandsea to
run properly. The version number, backup location, and similar data are all stored under .SSDs. While I think it's ok for you to edit other files for compatibility on your
device, it's not recommended that you edit these files because it might break the engine. (quite possibly the backups too - say goodbye to your simulations.)
